Usage
Once you have the app running locally, you can use it like a regular e-commerce platform. Browse the different product categories, view product details, and add items to your cart. The layout is responsive, meaning it will automatically adjust based on the screen size.

Adding Products
The current product data is hardcoded for demonstration purposes. You can easily extend the app to fetch product data from a backend API.
